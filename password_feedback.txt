✅ 1. abc123
Feedback:
This password is extremely weak due to its simplicity and widespread usage. It follows a common pattern and is frequently found in leaked password databases. It lacks complexity, making it highly vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
Suggestion: Avoid using common sequences or any variation of "abc" or "123".

✅ 2. Abc123
Feedback:
Although this password introduces capital letters, it is still considered very weak. It remains predictable and follows a familiar structure commonly targeted by attackers.
Suggestion: Increase length and add symbols or unrelated words for complexity.

✅ 3. ABC@123
Feedback:
This password includes a symbol, which slightly improves strength, but the base pattern (ABC123) is sequential and easily guessable.
Suggestion: Avoid keyboard patterns or sequential numbers; include random elements instead.

✅ 4. Abc@123
Feedback:
This password improves slightly with mixed-case and symbol inclusion, but still uses recognizable word fragments and a common number pattern, reducing its security.
Suggestion: Use non-dictionary words and consider making it a passphrase or using unrelated character groups.

✅ 5. a1B2c#@321
Feedback:
A solid password that uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Its structure is not easily predictable, which increases its resistance to basic attacks.
Suggestion: It’s a good password, though slightly longer length (12+ characters) would make it even stronger.

✅ 6. Skyler@2007
Feedback:
This password appears personal and includes a name and year, which are often easily guessed or found via social engineering. The @ symbol is helpful, but overall it's still weak.
Suggestion: Avoid using names, birth years, or anything personally identifiable. Add randomness or unrelated characters.

✅ 7. 100204@ghz#
Feedback:
A strong password with a good mix of numbers, letters, and symbols. It does not include dictionary words and is sufficiently complex to withstand brute-force attacks.
Suggestion: Excellent structure. You may improve further by increasing its length to 14+ characters for maximum security.

✅ 8. D!e2E5Z98N8Ut%s
Feedback:
Outstanding password. This is a highly complex, lengthy, and random mix of characters. It has excellent entropy and no recognizable patterns, making it very secure.
Suggestion: No improvement needed—this is a great example of a strong password.
