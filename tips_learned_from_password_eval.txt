Tips Learned from the Password Evaluation
Avoid Common Passwords
Passwords like abc123, Abc123, and variations of simple patterns are extremely weak and commonly used. These are the first targets in brute-force and dictionary attacks.

Do Not Use Personal Information
Including names (e.g., Skyler) and years (e.g., 2007) makes passwords predictable. Attackers often use social engineering or leaked data to guess such combinations.

Use Mixed Character Types
Strong passwords contain a mix of:

Uppercase letters (A–Z)

Lowercase letters (a–z)

Numbers (0–9)

Special symbols (!, @, #, %, etc.)

Length Increases Security
Longer passwords (12+ characters) significantly increase resistance to brute-force attacks. Passwords like D!e2E5Z98N8Ut%s are excellent due to their length and complexity.

Avoid Predictable Patterns and Sequences
Patterns like 123, ABC, or keyboard sequences (qwerty) are easily cracked. Even with symbols, these patterns are still weak.

Use Uncommon, Random Combinations
Passwords that lack real words and use non-repeating, random characters are much stronger and less likely to appear in dictionary-based cracking tools.

Consider Using Passphrases
A string of unrelated words (e.g., Blue!Chair$Monkey@2025) can be both strong and easier to remember.

Test Passwords Using Online Strength Checkers
Tools like passwordmeter.com help evaluate password strength and provide actionable feedback.

Each Character Type Adds Entropy
Adding just one special symbol or an uppercase letter can significantly increase the number of possible combinations, making a password exponentially harder to crack.

Use a Password Manager
Since strong passwords are often complex and hard to remember, using a password manager helps store and generate secure passwords without needing to memorize them.
