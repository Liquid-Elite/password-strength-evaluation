1. What makes a password strong?

A strong password is one that is difficult for both humans and machines to guess or crack. Characteristics of a strong password include:
Length: At least 12–16 characters long.
Complexity: Includes a mix of:
Uppercase letters (A–Z)
Lowercase letters (a–z)
Numbers (0–9)
Special symbols (!, @, #, $, etc.)
Unpredictability: Does not follow predictable patterns like 1234 or abcd.
No personal information: Avoids names, birthdays, or words related to the user.
No dictionary words: Single real words can be guessed using dictionary attacks.
A good example: D!e2E5Z98N8Ut%s — long, complex, random, and secure.


2. What are common password attacks?

Here are the most frequent attacks used to steal or crack passwords:
Brute-Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found.
Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common or real words to guess passwords.
Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked credentials from one site to try logging into others.
Phishing: Tricks users into entering passwords on fake websites.
Keylogging: Malware records keystrokes to steal passwords.
Rainbow Table Attack: Uses precomputed hash tables to crack hashed passwords quickly.
Each of these attacks exploits weak, reused, or predictable passwords.


3. Why is password length important?

Password length increases entropy, which refers to the number of possible combinations. Longer passwords:
Require exponentially more time and resources to crack using brute-force.
Are generally harder to guess or brute-force even with powerful computers.
Make attacks like rainbow tables and dictionary attacks less effective.
For example:
A 6-character password using only lowercase has ~308 million combinations.
A 12-character password with mixed characters has over 6 quadrillion combinations.
More characters = more security.


4. What is a dictionary attack?

A dictionary attack is a method where the attacker attempts to guess passwords by systematically testing each word from a precompiled list (called a "dictionary").
Often used because many users choose common words or phrases as passwords.
Faster than brute-force because it targets likely candidates first.
Defense:
Avoid using single dictionary words.
Add random numbers, symbols, and unrelated words.
Use passphrases or nonsensical combinations.


5. What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to present two or more different types of evidence to verify their identity:
Something you know: Password or PIN.
Something you have: Mobile phone, security token, smart card.
Something you are: Biometric data (fingerprint, face scan, iris scan).
Example: Logging into your email with a password + OTP sent to your phone.
Benefits:
Even if your password is stolen, the attacker still cannot log in without the second factor.
Drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access.


6. How do password managers help?

Password managers are tools that generate, store, and autofill strong, unique passwords for every website.
Advantages:
Eliminate the need to remember multiple complex passwords.
Encourage the use of long, randomized, secure passwords.
Protect against phishing (many managers won’t autofill credentials on fake websites).
Secure data storage using strong encryption.
Popular examples: LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password, Dashlane.


7. What are passphrases?

A passphrase is a sequence of words or a full sentence used as a password.
Example: Correct!Horse$Battery_Staple9
Benefits:
Easier to remember than random character strings.
Much stronger than a single dictionary word.
Harder to guess if the words are unrelated and include symbols/numbers.
Tips:
Avoid famous quotes or phrases.
Mix in capitalization and punctuation for complexity.


8. What are common mistakes in password creation?

Users often make poor password choices that expose them to attacks. Common mistakes include:
Using common passwords (e.g., 123456, password, qwerty).
Using personal information (e.g., name, birthday, phone number).
Reusing passwords across multiple sites.
Using short passwords (less than 8–10 characters).
Relying on simple patterns (e.g., abcd1234, aaaa1111).
Using full dictionary words (e.g., sunshine, football).
Not updating passwords after a breach or security warning.
Avoiding these mistakes is essential for good password hygiene.
