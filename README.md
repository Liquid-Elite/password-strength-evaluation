# password-strength-evaluation
A study and practical evaluation of password complexity, strength, and security practices using online tools.
# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation & Cybersecurity Report

This repository documents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of password strength using online tools, along with research into password creation best practices and common attack methods. The objective is to understand what makes a password secure and how password complexity impacts protection against various cyber threats.

---

## 📌 Objective

To explore the concept of strong passwords by:
- Creating and testing multiple passwords of varying complexity.
- Evaluating their strength using online tools such as [passwordmeter.com](http://www.passwordmeter.com).
- Learning best practices for creating strong, secure, and memorable passwords.
- Researching common password attack techniques (e.g., brute-force, dictionary).
- Summarizing the relationship between password complexity and real-world security.
- Preparing for technical interviews with detailed Q&A on password security.

## 🧪 Tools Used

- ✅ **Password Strength Checker:** [passwordmeter.com](http://www.passwordmeter.com)
- 🧠 **Research Sources:** OWASP, Cybersecurity Blogs, NIST Guidelines
- 📊 **Manual Evaluation Metrics:** Length, entropy, character variety, predictability

📊 Password Testing Summary
The project includes the testing of various passwords, ranging from weak to strong. Example:

Password	Score (%)	Tool Feedback
abc123	10%	Very weak – common and predictable
Abc@123	20%	Weak – includes dictionary elements and simple sequences
a1B2c#@321	80%	Good – mixed characters, length, randomness
Skyler@2007	40%	Weak – includes dictionary word and birth year
100204@ghz#	90%	Strong – high complexity and non-dictionary phrases
D!e2E5Z98N8Ut%s	95%	Excellent – high entropy, length, symbols, unpredictability

🧠 Key Learnings
🔑 Tips for Creating Strong Passwords:
Use 12–16 characters or more.

Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

Avoid real words, names, or keyboard patterns (like "qwerty").

Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts.

Use passphrases (e.g., Blue!Pine-Glass_Train88) for memorable yet secure options.

❌ Common Mistakes:
Using short or predictable passwords (e.g., abc123, password1).

Including personal info (names, DOBs).

Relying on common patterns (abcd, 12345678).

Reusing the same password on multiple sites.

🛡️ Common Password Attacks
Attack Type	Description
Brute-Force	Attempts all possible combinations
Dictionary Attack	Uses lists of common words to guess passwords
Credential Stuffing	Reuses leaked credentials from data breaches
Phishing	Tricks users into entering passwords on fake sites
Keylogging	Malware records keystrokes to steal passwords
Rainbow Table	Uses precomputed hashes to speed up password cracking

🔐 Importance of Password Complexity
Password complexity directly impacts how secure a system is from unauthorized access:

Longer + more varied passwords = higher entropy = more secure

Complex passwords defend better against brute-force and dictionary attacks

Unique passwords per service mitigate risk from data breaches

Pairing strong passwords with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) boosts protection
