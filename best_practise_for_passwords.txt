Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Use a Long Password (12–16+ Characters)

The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.

Passwords with 16+ characters offer strong protection against brute-force attacks.

Include a Mix of Character Types
A strong password should contain at least:

Uppercase letters (A–Z)

Lowercase letters (a–z)

Numbers (0–9)

*Special characters (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, , etc.)

Avoid Dictionary Words and Common Phrases

Do not use complete words, names, or popular phrases.

Avoid anything easily guessable like Password123, qwerty, or iloveyou.

Do Not Use Personal Information

Birthdays, names, phone numbers, or any identifiable data should be avoided.

Attackers often use social media or public data to guess passwords.

Avoid Predictable Patterns or Repeated Characters

Passwords like abcd1234, aaaa1111, or 12345678 are easily cracked.

Use non-sequential, random character combinations.

Use Passphrases for Memorability and Strength

Combine unrelated words with numbers and symbols:
Example: Blue!Horse$Lamp9Door

These are easier to remember and still hard to guess.

Make Every Password Unique

Never reuse the same password across multiple sites or accounts.

Reusing passwords increases the risk of credential stuffing attacks.

Change Passwords Regularly

Update passwords periodically, especially for sensitive accounts like email, banking, or cloud storage.

Change immediately if a breach or compromise is suspected.

Use a Password Manager

Helps generate and store strong, unique passwords securely.

Reduces the need to memorize complex passwords.

Test Password Strength Before Use

Use trusted tools like passwordmeter.com or haveibeenpwned.com to check if a password is strong and hasn’t been exposed in a data breach.
