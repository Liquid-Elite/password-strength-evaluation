ommon Password Attacks
Understanding how attackers break passwords is essential to creating secure ones. Below are the most common methods used in password cracking:

1. Brute-Force Attack
Definition:
A brute-force attack tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

How It Works:

The attacker uses software to generate and test millions or billions of password guesses.

Short or simple passwords are cracked quickly.

Defense:

Use long passwords (12+ characters).

Include random characters and symbols.

Enable account lockout after failed attempts.

2. Dictionary Attack
Definition:
Attempts to crack passwords by systematically trying common words and phrases from a precompiled list (dictionary).

How It Works:

The attacker uses a list of commonly used passwords and known words.

Passwords like welcome123, password, or admin are often cracked in seconds.

Defense:

Avoid dictionary words or predictable phrases.

Use nonsense combinations or passphrases with unrelated words and symbols.

3. Credential Stuffing
Definition:
An attack where stolen username/password pairs from data breaches are used to log in to other websites.

How It Works:

Attackers use leaked credentials from one site to try accessing accounts on other platforms.

Works because many users reuse passwords.

Defense:

Never reuse passwords across different sites.

Use a password manager to create unique credentials for each site.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).

4. Phishing
Definition:
A social engineering attack that tricks users into revealing their password through fake emails or websites.

How It Works:

User clicks on a fake link (e.g., fake banking site) and enters login credentials.

Attacker collects the data in real time.

Defense:

Check URLs carefully.

Never click on suspicious email links.

Use anti-phishing filters and 2FA.

5. Keylogging
Definition:
A method where malware records keystrokes to capture passwords as you type.

How It Works:

Installed via malicious software or phishing.

Sends the typed information to the attacker.

Defense:

Use antivirus software.

Avoid downloading files or software from untrusted sources.

Consider using a virtual keyboard for sensitive logins.

6. Rainbow Table Attack
Definition:
Uses precomputed hash values for commonly used passwords to match against stored password hashes.

How It Works:

Instead of cracking the password, it matches the hash in a lookup table.

Fast and efficient if passwords are unsalted.

Defense:

Always salt passwords (add random data before hashing).

Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
